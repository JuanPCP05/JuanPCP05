I'm a developer, systems technician, and systems engineering student with experience in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Publisher for office automation. 
In tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects, I can design, create, and edit video and pictures. 
I'm interested in cybersecurity and know a little about it, plus I've developed a self-taught learning system that helps me to quickly solve any problem. 
I am capable of working in both groups and alone, attempting to achieve the greatest outcomes possible in each of the activities available.
